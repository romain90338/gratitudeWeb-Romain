## Overview:
Daily Gratitude is an app created to help the user start their day on a calming and positive note.

Upon opening the app the user is prompted to choose between one of various meditation themes, such as Ocean, Nature, White Noise, or even Guided Meditation for beginners.

Once a selection is made, the user is brought to a page where a timer, set to the user's time of choice, will start to countdown. The countdown is the amount of time the user will have to meditate or, without doing anything else, relax to the themed selected sounds.

After the meditation timer is up, the user will be brought to a page which contains an input field to enter something you are grateful for. The gratitude entry only occurs once per day.

The user is then brought back to the home page where they can optionally select another meditation or take a look at their gratitude calendar, which shows all of their past daily gratitude entries.
